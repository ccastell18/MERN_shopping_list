MERN (Mongo - Express - React - Node.JS) Shopping List

This is a shopping list project, made using a tutorial, was to practice using a MERN stack.  I built the server on the back end with node and connecting it to a MongoDB. It can list all items in shopping list, add item to shopping list, and delete item from shopping list.  All actions are reflected in the MongoDB.  The front end is created with React and designed using Reactstrap. It is designed with an 'add item' button that renders a modal for entering new item.  Each item on the list is displayed in a box, in descending order, with a delete button withn in each box.  Then delete button removes the item from the MongoDB by it's unique id. The whole front end is then encompassed by React Redux.  All actions are then connected to the backend with node.JS and Redux.  The final project is fully functional.
